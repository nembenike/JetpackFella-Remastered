# JetpackFella Remastered

C# Rewrite of my C (raylib) game [jetpack-fella](https://github.com/nembenike/jetpack-fella)

- Written in WPF

## AI Usage

Since WPF is not a fully fledged game engine, I used AI for parts of porting the game to this framework.

## How to play
You are a poor little blue square who needs fuel (yellow squares) to survive in space. In case you run out of fuel, you'll fall out of bounds, which is game over. Be aware of the falling asteroids of variable sizes, as they decrease your fuel level. The bigger the asteroid the bigger the fuel deduction.

- Use Space for blasting your engines
- Use WASD/Arrow keys for using your thrusters to move sideways
- Wrap around the screen for some crazy tricks
